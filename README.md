# HertzPictureApp
Team 3 - Stefan Oswald, Brent Oliver, Rabeet Fatmi, Lloyd Gibson

We used AppGyver and Steroids to create this app that can be run on any device.
We left their example alone and altered these files:
myProject\app\example\views\getting-started.html
myProject\app\example\views\using-the-scanner.html
